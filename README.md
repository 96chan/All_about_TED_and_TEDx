Our Goal
================

TED is a nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It started out (in 1984) as a conference bringing together people from three worlds: Technology, Entertainment, and Design. The TED Open Translation Project brings TED Talks beyond the English-speaking world by offering subtitles, interactive transcripts and the ability for any talk to be translated by volunteers worldwide. The project was launched with 300 translations, 40 languages and 200 volunteer translators; now, there are more than 32,000 completed translations from the thousands-strong community. The TEDx program is designed to give communities the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at the local level.

Our project wants to encourage people to translate TEDx Talk as well by showing how TEDx Talk videos are translated and spreaded among different languages, places and topics, and comparing the spreading status with TED Talk videos.
The questions we are trying to answer:

1) How are the TEDx videos distributed among different languages and places?
2) How is the spreading status of TEDx videos comparing to that of TED videos?
